                        <h3>Who I am</h3>
                        I'm Gaurav, a professional translator specializing in Japanese to English localization.
                        Having 3+ years of experience working with big projects, I can bring reliability, quality and consistency to any project of your dreams.

                        Initially a webdeveloper by trade, I got interested in this field after I saw the value I could bring to it, being an individual who respects the original work and intentions of the author, hoping to translate them without forgetting the reason why.

                        To me, the most important thing when doing any job is speed and customer satisfaction. If the customer is not happy with the product, I do not feel happy delivering it. Everything must pass my own quality standards before it does yours. Yet, at the same time, I also make it a point to set my own deadlines if the customer will not. Time is money, and I am not keen on wasting yours. Priding myself on my "can do" attitude, I will make sure that a project succeeds on time and within budget, no matter how many caffeine filled all nighters I have to pull to do so.

                        In my free time, I immerse myself in Japanese content to learn even more about the language I ply my trade using.

                        <h3>Past Experiences</h3>
                        Due to the nature of freelance work, I have dabbled in a bit of everything, including web development and content writing. I always hold myself to the same standards, so you can be sure you're getting a good value for anything and everything.
                        Here are but a few short examples of tricky excerpts I've had to localize.

                    <div id="contentThree">
                        <h3>Translation Process</h3>
                        My work process includes researching the project, understanding the context under which it was written, and making sure to communicate with the client for a final decision on any particular hairballs.

                    <div id="contentFour">
                        <h3>Contact Me</h3>
                        I'm an easy man to get a hold of. Reach me by email, by Telegram, by Discord DMs or even Twitter. I provide free quotes for any project, no matter how big or small. I look forward to hearing from you!
